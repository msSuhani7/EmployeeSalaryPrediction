# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction System

This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict employee salaries using key features such as education, experience, job role, and more. The system is built with Flask for the web interface and uses a Random Forest Regressor for prediction. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle.
